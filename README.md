# Noteworthy: A Notetaking-app created with React (Next.js)

> Ready to embark on a note-taking journey? Create `noteworthy notes` with `Noteworthy`. Note is shared among all the users. However, only the note's creator can edit and delete it.

> I am recreating this app in React by using the same backend
