# Noteworthy: A Notetaking-app created with React (Next.js)

> Ready to embark on a note-taking journey? Create `noteworthy notes` with `Noteworthy`. Note is shared among all the users. However, only the note's creator can edit and delete it.

> I am recreating this app in React by using the same backend and CSS styles I used in Vue.js version


### Tools that will be used

### Responsive Design

### Functionalities to be added

- The app allows the user to create and read notes
- Created notes are saved and retrieved on next visit
