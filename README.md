# Noteworthy: A Notetaking-app created with React

> Ready to embark on a note-taking journey? Create `noteworthy notes` with `Noteworthy`. Note is shared among all the users. However, only the note's creator can edit and delete it.

> I am recreating this app in React by using the same backend

### Tools used

> Frontend

- `React` used as a Frontend Framework
- `TypeScript`
- `Material UI (MUI5)` used as CSS framework
- `CSS`
- `React router` used for routing
- `Redux Toolkit` used for managing global states
- `Axios` using Axios instead of fetch in this (React) version
- `Material Icons` used for icons in this version instead of font-awesome

> Backend

- `Node.js`
- `Express.js`
- `MongoDB (cloud)`

> Testing: it will be also added later

- `Cypress` for end to end testing

### Responsive Design

- The website is made responsive. Pictures will be added once I complete the project

### Functionalities added

- Backend added and routes were tested using `postman`
- Requires a login to access
- It allows for more than one user. Each user have a username and an individual password
- 404 page redirects user to home page
- The app allows the user to create and read notes
- Created notes are saved and retrieved on next visit
- It shows which user created a note. Note can be opened in a modal when clicked on card content.
- It allows only note's creator to edit and delete it.
- A note's creator is also allowed to make their note private which means other users can't see it

### Functionalities to be added
